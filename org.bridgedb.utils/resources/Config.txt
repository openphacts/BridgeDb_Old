#This is an example Config.txt file with the default values in it.
#To set your own file copy this file for example to $CATALINA_HOME/conf/OPS-IMS and edit it there.
#Ideally point Environment variable OPS-IMS-CONFIG to the folder containing your config files.

###########Main SQL Database and user settings #######################

#Test Database 
#Test Database MUST NOT be the main or load Database as tests drops and recreates all tables!
#Test user may be the same but having a different users adds security

#Directories configuration
#WARNING leaving the default relative links is not recommended.
#Relative links will fail if loading and running is not done from the same directory.
#Remember that the parent directories (in the defaults ../***) MUST exist.
#Remember to grant READ and WRITE ACCESS to all users running any bridgedb programs including tomcat.

#BaseURI should match the localing the war will be propped to or links will not work.
BaseURI                 http://localhost:8080/OPS-IMS/

#WARNING leaving the default relative links is not recommeneded!
#Relative links will fail if loading and running is not done from the same directory.
#Remember that these directies (in the defaults ../rdf/linksets and ../rdf/testLinksets) MUST exist, 
#Remember to grant READ and WRITE ACCESS to all users running any BridgeDB programs including tomcat.

############ RDF Repository ##############
#Main RDF store
SailNativeStore         ../rdf/linksets

#Load RDF Store
#This give the option of having a seperate load database to reload all data while he service stays live.
#Note: You will have to stop start the service (or drop in a new war) after swapping load and production servers
LoadSailNativeStore     ../rdf/linksets
#Defaults to SailNativeStore if not set

#Test and temporary RDF store
#This folder MUST exist as for non admins to save data in and is therefor used in validation.
#WARNING do not set the test store to be the same as the production store as many of the tests erases the store!
#the default relative directory will use the RDF directory directly below $BridgeDB
TestSailNativeStore     ../rdf/testLinksets

##### Transitive ############
#This section is only used IMS that extends this code.

#This section is used to save transitive files automatically created.
#Location where transitive files will be written to
#It is highly recommended to replace the relative link with an absolute one
#If setting up a webservice this could be a folder under webapps
#The transitive files are than accessible to the webserver
#For example {cataline_home}/webapps/Transitive
TransitiveDirectory     ../Transitive

#Base URI for Transitives 
#This allows a normal (http..) URI rather than a "file.." URI to be used as the source 
#This allows webservice clients to access the files.
#If TransitiveBaseUri is not set a "file.. " URI is used 

TransitiveBaseUri       http://localhost:8080/Transitive/

#Directory where all junit tests will write to 
#This directory is cleared at the begining of each test run.
#Warning WS Client test will still cause the server to write to the normal directories.
TestDirectory           ../TestDirectory



####### Accounts ###########
#NOTE: This section is not used by BridgeDB and is included here purely to present a unique config file across all OpenPhacts projects.

#Use this file to add logins and passwords to read uris.
#For example to read uris from remote sites.
#Note: the standard data loading for OpenPhacts 1.2 does not use any password protected sites.

#This information is exposed through the AccountsReader.java which returns an AccountsInfo object

#It is REQUIRED that you make a copy of this file and save it in a higher priority location
#Please see the README.txt file in the BridgeDB root directory.
#Do not put real passwords directly in this file.
#Do add uris for which passwords could be obtained
#This file is updated to a PUBLIC github repository

#All Properties keys should be in a two part format separated by a full stop.
#First part is a group identifier
#Second part is the account settings
    #uri   : first part of the uri.
           # key for finding the account settings
    #login : or user name
    #password
#To add second parts please edit the Java classes AccountInfo and AccountsReader

#Additional property groups can be added without any code change.
#Just use a unique first part

#The ops github repository includes a Read Only account.
#Please ask Christian for the password of that account
